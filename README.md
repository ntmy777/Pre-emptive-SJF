# Pre-emptive Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling

This project simulates the **Pre-emptive Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling** algorithm in an interactive web-based interface. Users can input process details (process name, arrival time, burst time, and priority) and visualize the scheduling results through a Gantt chart and tabular data.

## Features
1. **User Input:**
   - Enter process names, arrival times, burst times, and priorities.
2. **Gantt Chart Visualization:**
   - Displays how processes are scheduled over time.
3. **Detailed Metrics:**
   - Outputs Finishing Time, Turnaround Time, and Waiting Time for each process.
4. **Aggregate Metrics:**
   - Displays total and average turnaround and waiting times.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: HTML structure for user inputs and outputs.
- `style.css`: Contains styles for the Gantt chart, tables, and layout.
- `script.js`: Implements the Pre-emptive SJF scheduling logic and updates the DOM dynamically.
